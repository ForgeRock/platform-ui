    "[Vue warn]: (deprecation RENDER_FUNCTION) Vue 3's render function API has changed. You can opt-in to the new API with:

  configureCompat({ RENDER_FUNCTION: false })

  (This can also be done per-component via the "compatConfig" option.)

    "[Vue warn]: (deprecation COMPONENT_FUNCTIONAL) Functional component <BRow> should be defined as a plain function in Vue 3. The "functional" option has been removed. NOTE: Before migrating to use plain functions for functional components, first make sure that all async components usage have been migrated and its compat behavior has been disabled.

In Vue 3, parent v-on listeners are included in vm.$attrs and it is no longer necessary to separately use v-on="$listeners" if you are already using v-bind="$attrs".
