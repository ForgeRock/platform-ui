    "[Vue warn]: (deprecation COMPONENT_FUNCTIONAL) Functional component <BRow> should be defined as a plain function in Vue 3. The "functional" option has been removed. NOTE: Before migrating to use plain functions for functional components, first make sure that all async components usage have been migrated and its compat behavior has been disabled.
