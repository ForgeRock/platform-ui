  configureCompat({ RENDER_FUNCTION: false })

  (This can also be done per-component via the "compatConfig" option.)

    "[Vue warn]: (deprecation COMPONENT_FUNCTIONAL) Functional component <BBadge> should be defined as a plain function in Vue 3. The "functional" option has been removed. NOTE: Before migrating to use plain functions for functional components, first make sure that all async components usage have been migrated and its compat behavior has been disabled.

    "[Vue warn]: (deprecation INSTANCE_LISTENERS) vm.$listeners has been removed. In Vue 3, parent v-on listeners are included in vm.$attrs and it is no longer necessary to separately use v-on="$listeners" if you are already using v-bind="$attrs". (Note: the Vue 3 behavior only applies if this compat config is disabled)
