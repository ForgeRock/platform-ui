## Application structure


To help you with navigation, the application has the following basic layout:

  

```

tests/ - Folder containing the application tests

│

public/

├── static/ - Images and files that will not be processed by webpack

├── favicon.ico - Website fav icon

├── index.html - Application index.html

src/

├── components/ - General application components

│ ├── access/ - Delegated admin components

│ ├── dashboard/ - Dashboard widgets

│ ├── profile/ - Profile management components (KBA, profile edit, etc.)

│ ├── uma/ - User Managed Access integration

│ ├── utils/ - Variety of support components that are used throughout the application

│ ├── NotFound.vue/ - 404 page

│ └── OAuthReturn.vue/ - Handles OAuth returns for registration and login

├── assets - Images that will be processed by webpack

├── router - Application routes

├── i18n - Translation loader

├── scss/ - SCSS / CSS styling files

## Application tools

  

The following application tools are installed when you install the project dependencies:

  

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/) - Primary Javascript framework for the project

- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) - Application routing Vue library

- [Vue Bootstrap](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) - Bootstrap 4 Vue components

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Javascript Promise Library

- [Vue i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/en/) - Translation library for Vue

- [Vee Validate](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate) - Form validation for Vue

- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - Util library for preforming various efficient calculations

  

There are several other libraries included with both node and the application, but these are the primary core libraries used throughout. For additional libraries, see package.json `/package.json`

  

<a  name="translations-and-text"></a>

## Translations and Text

  

Application translation uses [Vue i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/en/) and the `openidm/info/uiconfig` endpoint to get the current user's browser language.

  

The project only contains `en` based translations and falls back to `en` if an unsupported language is detected. To change the default language fallback adjust VueI18n `/src/main.js`.

  

Adding and changing an existing message for the `en` base language involves either adding a key or editing an existing key.

Keys follow JSON structure; for example, if you wanted to edit the navigation bar `Profile` to `User Profile` you would need to locate the appropriate key `en.pages.app.profile` and change the text.

Inside of your Vue application you would then make use of that key with the built in translation function `{{$t('pages.app.profile')}}` or `this.$t('pages.app.profile')`.


Adding a new translation language means creating a new translation file inside of locales folder with a key matching the translation language code.

 
For example:


```

en.json

fr.json

gr.json

```

Then creating a JSON key structure that should be mirrored across all of the language files.

  
For example:

``` JSON
{
  dashboard: {
    welcomeMessage:  'Welcome!'
  }
}
```
  
<a  name="theming"></a>

## Theming


The following theming tools are installed when you install the project dependencies:


- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS enhancmenet library

- [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS Styling framework


Theming makes use of two concepts:


- Theming follows the basic [Bootstrap theming guidelines](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/) and relies on SCSS variable overrides.

- The theme file is loaded with an optional flag when running the dev server or distribution build. For example, `npm run dev --theme=red` or `npm run build --theme=red`.

 
When you include the theme flag, the `node` build scripts attempt to locate a corresponding file in `src/scss`. The file must also contain a `-theme.scss` moniker, for example, `red-theme.scss`.


The default project includes three themes:

- ForgeRock default theme

- ForgeRock dark theme `npm run --theme=dark`

- ForgeRock rock theme `npm run --theme=rock`. This theme demonstrates how to use a full background image, with fallback to the default theme.

## Browser support

  
- Latest Firefox

- Latest Safari

- Latest Chrome


<a name="environment-variables"></a>

## Environment variables

Currently environment variables are:

1. VUE_APP_AM_URL - URL to be used by default for authentication
2. VUE_APP_AM_ADMIN_URL - URL for the location of the AM admin UI
3. VUE_APP_IDM_URL - URL of AM instance that will be used for administration
4. VUE_APP_LOGIN_URL - URL for the location of the login UI
5. VUE_APP_ADMIN_URL - URL for the location of the admin UI
6. THEME - Will load a corresponding theme.scss file (example dark-theme.scss).
7. VUE_APP_ENDUSER_CLIENT_ID - defaults to 'end-user-ui'

These are made available in the .env file, and overridden by system environment variables in the .env.production file for dockerization.

Access in Vue files:

```
process.env.VUE_APP_AM_URL
process.env.VUE_APP_AM_ADMIN_URL
process.env.VUE_APP_IDM_URL
process.VUE_APP_LOGIN_URL
process.VUE_APP_ADMIN_URL
process.env.VUE_APP_ENDUSER_CLIENT_ID
process.env.THEME
```
