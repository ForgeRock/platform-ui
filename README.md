<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick start

- [Download and install the latest node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or verify your node version `node -v`
- Make sure you have yarn installed `brew install yarn`
- Clone or download the repo: `https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/UI/repos/platform-ui/browse` or `https://github.com/ForgeRock/platform-ui`
- Navigate to your `platform-ui` directory and install dependencies with yarn: `yarn`
- Depending on what project you wish to utilize. Update `proxyTable:target` in `vue.config.js` to point to your target 
- Start up target project (default startup is based on project, this information can be found in `vue.config.js`)
- Start development server with yarn: `yarn dev`

### Optional Help

Vue provides a CLI to help with managing clients if you wish to make use of it you can do the following
- Run command `yarn install -g @vue/cli` to install the Vue Client
- Then to open the management UI use `vue ui`

<a name="translations-and-text"></a>
## Translations and Text

Application translation uses [Vue i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/en/) and the `openidm/info/uiconfig` endpoint to get the current user's browser language.

The project only contains `en` based translations and falls back to `en` if an unsupported language is detected. To change the default language fallback adjust VueI18n `/src/main.js`.

Adding and changing an existing message for the `en` base language involves either adding a key or editing an existing key.
Keys follow JSON structure; for example, if you wanted to edit the navigation bar `Profile` to `User Profile` you would need to locate the appropriate key `en.pages.app.profile` and change the text.
Inside of your Vue application you would then make use of that key with the built in translation function `{{$t('pages.app.profile')}}` or `this.$t('pages.app.profile')`.

Adding a new translation language means creating a new translation file inside of locales folder with a key matching the translation language code.

For example:

```
en.json
fr.json
gr.json
```

Then creating a JSON key structure that should be mirrored across all of the language files.

For example:

``` JSON
    {
        dashboard: {
            welcomeMessage: 'Welcome!'
        }
    }
```

<a name="deployment"></a>
## Deployment

- To deploy the application, run: `yarn build`

Running `yarn build` creates a distribution file in the `dist` folder of that specific project. Each deployment use case is different.

<a name="theming"></a>
## Theming

The following theming tools are installed when you install the project dependencies:

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS enhancement library
- [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS Styling framework

Theming makes use of two concepts:

- Theming follows the basic [Bootstrap theming guidelines](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/) and relies on SCSS variable overrides.
- The theme file is loaded with an optional flag when running the dev server or distribution build. For example, `yarn dev --theme=red` or `yarn build --theme=red`.

When you include the theme flag, the `node` build scripts attempt to locate a corresponding file in `src/scss`. The file must also contain a `-theme.scss` moniker, for example, `red-theme.scss`.

The default project includes three themes:
- ForgeRock default theme
- ForgeRock dark theme `yarn dev --theme=dark`
- ForgeRock rock theme `yarn dev --theme=rock`. This theme demonstrates how to use a full background image, with fallback to the default theme.


<a name="build-command-summary"></a>
## Build command summary

Inside of the packages folder of the monorepo you will find each stand alone project. These stand alone projects all rely on similar commands, on occation there are minor differences (for example theming doesn't apply to admin). Please check and package.json to see the specific commands. Here is a list of the universal commands.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 (increments by 1 automatically if port is in use).
yarn dev

# server with theme loaded (not admin)
yarn dev --theme=red

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# build with theme loaded (not admin)
yarn build --theme=red

# run all tests
yarn unit
```
